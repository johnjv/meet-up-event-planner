[https://meet-up-event-planner.firebaseapp.com](https://meet-up-event-planner.firebaseapp.com)

## Overview

A responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event.

## Prerequisites

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`.
Node should respond with a version at or above 0.10.x.
If you require Node, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

### [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`.
If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.9.x.
If you need to install/upgrade Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

*This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to [configure your system](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install packages globally without administrative privileges.*


# How to Run

Clone repo and run

```sh
$ npm install
```

Serve up a local version of the site with gulp.  Watch for changes & automatically refresh across devices by running

```sh
$ gulp serve
```
